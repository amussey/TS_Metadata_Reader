TS Metadata reader and parser. It iterates through each TS packet and decodes the header. It also provides a
way to skip to any packet non-linearly, and supports iterating backwards.

It is useful for basic TS metadata analysis scripting, or could be used as the basis of a more complex TS metadata
analysis tool.

Note: Does not decode or de-multiplex a/v.

Also has command line interface to measure the duration of ts files based on pts or dts. Run as main for cli.

Simple Example Usage:

    file = "C:/videofiles/tsfile.ts"
    ts = TSRead(file)
    for x in ts:
        print x.decodedpts, x.decodeddts
        
        
Note 2: The code is not beautiful, but it works. I plan to pretty it up in the future.
